In php we require

Header ('Location : Path of your View file to show the html content').

Class named as "View" in view.php is used to show the display content without using " Header ('Location :)".
Just INCLUDE THIS FILE AND AND CALL FROM YOUR FUNCTION AS I USED IN "regiater.php".

I had used three files

1.regiater.php
2.view.php (Class whi is to be included)
3.viewfile.php
